<h1>About The Game</h1>

- This is a 3D adventure game made using Unity and C#. The goal of this project was to increase my skill in <b>Level Design</b> and <b>Character Creation</b>. as well as, work on implementing a <b>Save/Load</b> function.

- This game takes inspiration from others of its kind like Spiral Knights, Tunic, and Legend of Zelda (from the Toon link series)
