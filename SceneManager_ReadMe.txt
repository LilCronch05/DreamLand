WORKING:
- There are four small/average sized terrains
- The Player can move across all of them properly
	- When moving across to scene 4 however there is a slight stutter.
	  Just keep trying and it'll move over.
- Each scene is linked together and there is a clear path to follow
- The scenes only load when the character gets close to them. And there
  is a camera on the top right of the screen showing the whole game world
  to properly track the loading process.
- As long as you are in the regular camera view you won't notice the next scene loading in.
- There are enemies present in the game.
- There is a companion in the final zone that you can interact with and they will follow you.

NOT WORKING:
- If the camera is fully zoomed out, you can notice scene 3 loading from scene 2 and 4.
- You cannot attack the enemies and the enemies won't attack you (they will only chase until
  you switch scenes).
- The companion won't stop following you even when they reach the drop-off destination.

QUALITY OF LIFE:
- Hitting "Start Game" in the main menu will lead you straight to the last played file.
	- "Load Game" lets you pick which file you want to play on (although only one is working).
- You click to move (using right mouse button)
	- You cannot hold the mouse button down to move. Only click.
- You can change camera zoom with the scroll wheel.
- Avoid the "transfer gates" and the "Inn entrance" because those zones are disabled
  and will throw the character into Limbo.
- Holding the "left shift" key allows the player to stop moving.
